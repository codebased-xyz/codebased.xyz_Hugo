# Introduction 
*Traveler*, I welcome you to this *random* site on **the internet**. Chances are you won't find anything interesting here and that's fine :). Feel free to move around and explore my little *tech cave*! The whole thing is running on an old [**Dell Optiplex 990 (DT)**](https://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/documents/optiplex-990-spec-sheet.pdf)(**CPU**: i5 2400, **RAM**: 8GB DDR3 1333Mhz) that I found on allegro for 100PLN (~23USD^1) on [**Void Linux**](https://voidlinux.org/). Since this is my crappy homelab do expect it do be **down** sometimes ( or even break :( )
# So, what can I find here?  
The services hosted on this machine are:
- a *minimal* (tech)*["blog"](./blog/)* and website. **This!** : addr: [codebased.xyz](https://codebased.xyz/) | Live
- a [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) server: addr: [ntfy.codebased.xyz](https://codebased.xyz/) | Planned

# Now to get a little selfish...
My name is **Kacper** and I'm a random **teenager** (currently **14**) born(and living(so far)) in **Poland**.  
I am also a **computer nerd** (yes i compared the **definitions** of *nerd* and *geek*); I can program in **C++** & **Python** (also some Rust) Sometimes i indulge in some **GNU/Linux** *magic*.
