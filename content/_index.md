# Introduction 
*Traveler*, I welcome you to this *random* site on **the internet**. Chances are you won't find anything interesting here and that's fine :). Feel free to move around and explore my little *tech cave*! The whole thing is running on an old **Dell Optiplex 990** that I found on allegro for 100PLN (~23USD^1) on [**Void Linux**](https://voidlinux.org/). Since this is my crappy homelab do expect it do be **down** sometimes ( or even break :( )
# So, what can I find here?
For now nothing hosted on this machine is publicly accesible. I'm planning to host:
- a *minimal* (tech)*["blog"](./blog/)* and website. **This!** : addr: [codebased.xyz](https://codebased.xyz/)
- a [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/) server
- a fileserver ([copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty)): addr: [files.codebased.xyz](https://files.codebased.xyz/)
- a url shortener. (We shall find out what exactly!)
# Now to get a little selfish...
My name is **Kacper** and I'm a random **teenager** (currently **14**) born(and living(so far)) in **Poland**.  
I am also a **computer nerd**; I can program in **C++** & **Python** (also some Rust) Sometimes i indulge in some **GNU/Linux** *magic*.
An **Open source** and [crypto(graphic) anarchy](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/crypto-anarchist-manifesto/) (ad. [1](https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=Hq-nNSyGH1U) & [2](https://invidious.snopyta.org/watch?v=hdJ4CV524ls)) supporter. I also make some bad **pixel art** when bored.
